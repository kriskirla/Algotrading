## Algotrading Development

## Progress
- Frontend page with path `/portfolioanalyzer` completed with POST method to backend
- Need to work on backend to bring in the Portfolio Analyzer code
- Frontend will need to render a table to display portfolio
- Need to finish setting up docker, but will delay since docker is not yet supported on M1 Macbook
